    // defer can be changed with async
    // async attribute will execute as soon as download complete. can be better to be used when we want to run pages independently from each other and depend on no other script on pages, since they dont have any dependencies
    // defer attribute will load in the order of they are in and will only exeecute once everything has finished loading.
